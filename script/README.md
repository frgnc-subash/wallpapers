# This is wana.

Ammmm... hi â€” this is **wana**. I'm a simple bash script that can rename your wallpapers.

> Just run me and give me the path to your wallpapers. Easy peasy :3

---

## Quick Start

Make the script executable (one-time):

```bash
chmod +x ./wana.sh
```

Run the script:

```bash
./wana.sh
```

When prompted, give the path to your wallpapers (copy-paste this example):

```bash
/home/username/Pictures/wallpapers
```


## Troubleshooting

- If the script says "permission denied": make sure you ran `chmod +x ./wana.sh`.
- If it can't find your folder: ensure the path exists and you typed it exactly (copy-paste avoids typos).
- If nothing changes: check `wana.sh`'s logic and whether it filters files by extension.
